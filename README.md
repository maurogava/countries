# Countries APP

"Countries App" consist of a Home page with a list of all Countries. You can filter by name and if you click in a "Country Card" you will be redirected to a Country description page.
The APP is fully Responsive, also the images are being lazy loaded, and all content shifts are prevented.

The used tech stack is TypeScript, React, React Router, React Query, SCSS, CSS Modules, ESLint, Prettier.

I din't use any UI framework like Bootstrap or MUI so you can evaluate my knowledge without having those components as base, which makes some things simpler. Nevertheless this is just a challenge with room for improvements.
